    "\n",
    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised method for dimensionality reduction. The principal _components_ are vectors that can be considered as a direction in which the data is most variant. The first of these components \"explains\" more variance in the data than the second, and so forth. The _scores_ are numbers (\"scalars\") with which these components can be multiplied to reconstruct the original data. By taking only $k$ $d$-dimensional component vectors and an $n\\times k$ score matrix we have a compressed _approximate_ representation of an $n\\times d$-sized dataset. The information density of all involved numbers/vectors is hopefully higher.\n",

As PCA reduces the dimension of a dataset by calculating a relation between the different features, it does not make sense to do so where there are no relations expected to be found, and might even cause the model to lose efficiency.
