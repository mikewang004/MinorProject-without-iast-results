    "\n",
    "Gini index, also called Gini impurity, should not be confused with Gini coefficient. Both are named after the statistician Corrado Gini.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea is as follows. If a node is \"pure\", that is, all instances in it belong to the same class, then predicting the class of an instance is trivial. A pure node has a Gini index of 0. If a node isn't pure yet - meaning it has instances of more than one class in it, then we can calculate just how hard it is to classify instances in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we know the distribution of class labels in a node. For example, we could have a node with `A, A, A, A, A, A, B, B, B, B` in it. Then if we grabbed a random instance, we'd have 60% chance of `A` and 40% chance of `B`. Now suppose we get a new instance and we have to predict its label, and we use those probabilities that we know. So there's a 60% chance that we predict `A`, and 40% chance that we predict `B`. Now, how often are we wrong? That's what Gini impurity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of us being wrong are those of predicting `A` but getting `B` ($0.6 \\times 0.4 = 0.24$) and of predicting `B` but getting `A` ($0.4 \\times 0.6 = 0.24$), so a total of $0.24 + 0.24 = 0.48$. This is the same as 1 minus the chance of us getting it right, so $1 - (0.6^2 + 0.4^2) = 0.48$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine we have a proposed split of this node, that would result in child nodes `A, B, B, B, B` and `A, A, A, A, A`. The odds of getting it wrong in the first node are $1 - (0.2^2 + 0.8^2) = 0.32$. For the other node, the odds of getting it wrong are 0, because there's only one class to choose from. Their weights are each $\\frac{5}{10} = 0.5$ because each node is half the size of the original. So we multiply these impurities with their weights based on instances and get $(0.5 \\times 0.32) + (0.5 \\times 0) = 0.16. This is better than our original impurity of 0.48, so we'd be willing to make this split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formalize Gini Index in a formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Gini = 1 - \\sum_{j=1}^{||M||} p_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $p_j$ is the probability of a given instance being in class $j$, or that we predict an instance to be in class $j$ based on our knowledge of the class distribution in the training set. Then $p_j^2$ is then the probability that an instance is in class $j$ **and** that we predict it as $j$. So then $\\sum_{j=1}^{||M||} p_j^2$ is the sum of all possible ways we could correctly predict an instance's class, and the final formula subtracts that from 1 to get the chance of us being wrong."

    "\n",
    "[Shannon Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) was developed by Claude Shannon in the context of signal processing in lossy communication channels, such as trying to send digital signals over analog radio. The key idea is that you're measuring how much more information you would need to say with certainty which class a subject belongs in. In practice, entropy doesn't behave very differently from Gini index, and they simply came to machine learning out of different scientific fields. Entropy is a bit more computationally expensive to compute because of the logarithm, which is why Gini impurity tends to be the default measure.\n",

    "    * Determine the impurity for each of the child nodes.\n",

Since we're looking for an improvement, we would reject this split.\n",

For example, if we've already split animals on \"milk\" and are moving down the \"no\" subtree, splitting on milk again will yield no improvement. This is convenient because it prevents endless growth of the tree. \n",

The init method sets the stage for the variables you need to use to build the tree. The other methods help you visualize what you're doing - you can use them to see if you're on the right track.\n",

That way we use the definition of the Tree kind of datastructure, which says that the subtree of a tree is also a tree. So if the root DTree node splits, then the Yes and No side of it will also be DTree nodes, which might then get children of their own. All the way down, until we only have leaf nodes that aren't profitable to split anymore.\n",

    "    3. `test_DTree_fit_children` If the node is split, then the Yes and No sides both should have a new node attached to it.\n",
    "    4. `test_DTree_fit_recursively_children` This takes the idea of the previous test, but now applies it recursively. If a node is split then its children should be nodes. And if those nodes are split, then *their* children should also be nodes. All the way until you get to nodes that aren't split.\n",
    "    5. `test_DTree_fit_recursively_child_labels` With the previous test we established that our tree consists of branching nodes that go Yes and No, or leaf nodes that don't split. Now we can go down the tree to check if all the nodes have a label.\n",

You directly use it when you want to use something from *that instance* of the class. In this exercise for example, you're making multiple `DTree` objects.
